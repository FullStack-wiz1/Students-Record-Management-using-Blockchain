# Student Record Management using Blockchain

## Abstract
This project uses blockchain technology to manage student records securely and transparently. By leveraging the Ethereum blockchain, the system ensures data integrity and eliminates the need for centralized authorities. Key technologies include Ganache, Solidity, Remix IDE, HTML/CSS, Web3.js, Metamask, and Sepolia.

## System Overview
- **Objective:** Enhance security, transparency, and efficiency in managing student records using blockchain technology.
- **Solution:** Develop a decentralized system using Ethereum, smart contracts, and a user-friendly interface. Integrate with existing systems and ensure scalability and privacy.
- **Technologies:** Ethereum, Solidity, Remix IDE, Ganache, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, Web3.js, Metamask, Sepolia.

## Features
- **Decentralized Ledger:** Immutable and secure storage of student records on the Ethereum blockchain.
- **Smart Contracts:** Automate processes like enrollment and credential verification.
- **User Interface:** Front-end designed with HTML/CSS for easy interaction.
- **Blockchain Interaction:** Managed using Web3.js and Metamask.

## Setup
1. **Blockchain Setup:** Use Ganache for local development.
2. **Smart Contract Development:** Write and test contracts using Remix IDE.
3. **Front-End Design:** Create UI with HTML/CSS.
4. **Integration:** Connect with Ethereum using Web3.js and Metamask.
5. **Deployment:** Deploy contracts on Ethereum Mainnet and host the front-end.

## Requirements
- Ganache, Remix IDE, Metamask, Web3.js, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, Sepolia.
